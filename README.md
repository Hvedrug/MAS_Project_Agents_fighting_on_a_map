This work as been made for my Multiagent System class. It uses OpenAI gym based agents to simulate battle royal games (agents moving on a map and shooting at each other. 

launch project:
open terminal in main folder
run: python masMain.py

if you have issues with some import in the code try to run this one instead:
python masAlternativeVersion.py
